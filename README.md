# JASE.Suite

__JASE Suite__ is a lean, developer-centric tooling and component library for building high-performance, secure, and scalable systems on .NET.

## Why JASE Suite?
JASE Suite exists because too many enterprise frameworks are bloated, opinionated, and get in your way.
JASE is different:

- Zero ceremony.
- Zero unnecessary abstraction.
- Built for engineers who demand control and efficiency.

## What’s Inside (Coming Soon)
- Dynamic ORM and query layer.
- Lightweight client-server patterns.
- Encryption, networking, and diagnostics.
- Core extension libraries.
- Enhanced serialization for over-the-wire efficiency

## Status

__Alpha__ Expect sharp edges and rapid iteration.
__Stable__ Production-ready modules will follow.
